Welcome to MFiX-EXA's documentation!
====================================

MFiX-Exa is a new multiphase modeling tool for the exascale.  It
combines kernels from the existing MFiX code with the AMReX framework.

MFiX-Exa is under active development as part of the MFiX-Exa 
application project in DOE's Exascale Computing Project. 

All of MFiX-Exa's development is done in the NETL gitlab repository, with 
active development in the develop branch. Changes are merged into
the master branch at the beginning of each month.
