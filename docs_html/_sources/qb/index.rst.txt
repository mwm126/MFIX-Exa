Qualitative Benchmarks
======================

MFiX-Exa uses a three level approach to regression testing spaning from simple
and/or short smoke tests to validation problems comparing against experimental
data. Most of the validation benchmarks target the physics of interest to 
MFiX-Exa's intended audience, i.e., dense bubbling, fast fluidization and 
pneumatic transport of particulate solids by a light gas. In an effort to widen 
the phase-space in which MFiX-Exa may be (potentially) applied, a set of 
qualitative benchmark problems are provided below which focus more on the 
phenomenology of a given, problem rather than averaged statistical measures. 
Animations of numerical soluitons to several of the qualitative benchmarks 
can be seen in the
