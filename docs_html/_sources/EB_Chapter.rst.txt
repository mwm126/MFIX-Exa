Embedded Boundaries
===================

MFiX-Exa uses AMReX's Embedded Boundaries to represent container walls. This
allows MFiX-Exa to simulate a wide range of shapes and boundary conditions using
constructive solid geometry. MFiX-Exa also has the capability of locally
refining the computational meshes near walls.
